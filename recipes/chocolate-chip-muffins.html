        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 spoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Combine milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl until well blended. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Combine 1 Â½ tablespoons white sugar and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle on tops of muffins.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Line an airtight container with paper towels, then arrange the muffins in a single layer. If you're worried about the muffins drying out, throw in a saltine cracker to absorb the excess moisture. Store at room temperature for up to four days.</li>
            <li>You can freeze these chocolate chip muffins for up to two months. Thaw at room temperature or gently defrost the muffins in the microwave.</li>
        </ul>

# odin-recipes
This project is to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired at this point in time through TOP.
This project uses headings, paragraphs, images, links and related stuff.

Will update more on this later.

Edit after completion of project:

I forgot add what does the project contain. So, it has 3 recipes taken from allrecipes.com
I used headings in an hierarchical order like h1 for name of the dish, h2 for Description, Ingredients and Steps and so on.
I used lists to make things orgnized.
